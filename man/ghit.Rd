\title{Lightweight GitHub Package Installer}
\description{
ghit provides a single function, \code{\link{install_github}}, which allows users to install R packages hosted on GitHub without needing to install or load the heavy dependencies required by devtools. ghit provides a drop-in replacement that provides (almost) identical functionality.
